# Heard 

**Heard** is a one-sentence journaling app with a twist: users type a message, select a tone, choose an emoji level, and receive a single, personalized response in return. No conversation threads, no advice - just one moment of being heard.

##  Why I Built It
This app was created as part of a full-stack Django, session-based authentication project. The goal was to create something technically solid while experimenting with creative tone outputs and user-driven input. Heard pushes beyond basic CRUD by personalizing AI-style responses based on user-selected tone and emoji level.
